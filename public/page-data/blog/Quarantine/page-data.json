Except I can't leave home, can't go to the gym, can't see my friends and good part of my family.\n<h3>Gym</h3>\n<p>With some creativity I managed to get myself a homegym. I have a bar with some weights, about 30kg total, which gives me some accessories. But for the main lifts I made a 40kg sandbag using tape and sand, and a 30kg one. It's crazy how much you can do with it. Just carrying them around is a great workout, honestly, but bear squats, floor to shoulder, and presses have been great.<p>\n<h3>Studying</h3>\n<p>Not leaving the house gives me a LOT of time and incentive to study though, that's for sure. I've been keeping up with my projects, Gardn is basically ready, my website is more beautiful than ever, and I've been studying film history and how to watch and critique. It's been fun, not gonna lie, you know, except for the imminent threat of a deadly virus.","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantined","date":"March 28, 2020","description":"Is it spring already?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/Quarantine/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/tony-stark/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tony Stark"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/counting-subsequences/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Number of distinct subsequences of string1 in string2"}}}}}
