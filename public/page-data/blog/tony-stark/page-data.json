Since January 2019, to be precise. I'll eventually, in another point this year, plot my weight changes, body fat percentage, bench press/deadlift/press/squat, and calories eaten in a nice graph. For now though, I'll just make a promise to myself to start my personal assistant. That's my first step to become the Iron Man himself.\n<h3>A database</h3>\n<p>It's funny how much fanciness we can add to a database. That's what will be at first, at least, just a database with all food I eat that tracks my calories and macros and builds statistics on that. A quick interface, maybe linked to my website or my Digital Ocean server, and I'll have something more customized than any MyFitnessPal around there. Fortunately I've been tracking my calories in a Google Sheet, and not in some random app, so I have basically a database. Just have to insert it properly with SQL.<p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tony Stark","date":"February 17, 2020","description":"Jarvis, what are the macronutrients on this sandwich?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/tony-stark/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/summer-vaycay/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Summer Vaycay"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/Quarantine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantined"}}}}}
