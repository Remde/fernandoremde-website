description: "I missed being productive"
---


<p>This last semester I bit a little more than I could chew. Or, actually, exactly what I could chew, since I handled it, but... to what cost?</p>
<p>Not that BIG of a cost, honestly. Guess I can't be as dramatic as some writers. But it did took a toll on my will to program and be productive, certainly. I haven't had much time to just work on personal projects or learn some new tech, which I've always liked to do. I mean, time is not exactly the concern, but I was feeling burned out.</p>

<h3>Vacation</h3>
But it's summer time, and you know what that means, gotta head on to the beach and do some beachy things. Or code. I'm glad my passion and creativity is coming back. I re-started this blog, learned a little bit more of React, started Redux, and will be doing a Web Message App to improve my back-end skills. It's looking good. I've been feeling great and looking forward to whatever happens this year.</p>
